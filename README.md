# Logic Tutor
Logic Tutor provides a standalone application consistent of 4 parts.
- A study part to view theory and study propositional logic.
- An evaluation tool used to evaluate any propositional logic expression and produce truth tables.
- A manipulation tool that can be used to manipulate any propositional logic expression according to the rules of propositional calculi. It can also be used for system modeling as it provides deduction rules as well.
- An examination part with multiple questions about propositional logic.

There are two ways to run the code:
-
- Import this project as an exciting Maven IntelliJ project and make sure to download all the dependencies of the pom.xml file.
- The second way by executing the LogicTutor.jar file in out/artifacts/LogicTutor_jar/.
  - If the execution failed in Windows 10 and 11, then Open a terminal inside the specified directory and run the following command:
    -       java -jar LogicTutor.jar
  - Inside the LogicTutor_jar directory, you will also find a savedEvaluations directory and a savedManipulations one: they are used for saving results from the application.
  - Finally, you will also find a DB directory that holds the database, you do not need to touch that. It is used to load test questions onto the application.
